      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am Mohamed Elbayomi, a Computer Science student at Dalhousie University with a strong interest in football performance analysis and data-driven decision making in sports.</p>
      
      <p>I previously played as a goalkeeper, which gave me a tactical understanding of match dynamics, defensive structures, and build-up strategies. This experience naturally led me into the analytical side of football.</p>
      
      <p>My work focuses on:
        <ul>
          <li>Player performance evaluation</li>
          <li>Match analysis & tactical breakdowns</li>
          <li>Data visualization for coaching & scouting support</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Technical Skills: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tableau, React, Git, AWS.</p>
      
      <p>Career Goal: Contribute to a football club or analytics organization by combining tactical knowledge with data science to support smarter coaching, scouting, and game preparation.</p>
