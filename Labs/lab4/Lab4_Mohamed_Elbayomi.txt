## Description
This project is a Recipe Recommender web application created for CSCI 3172 Lab 4.  
The app allows anyone input one or more ingredients (for example: chicken, rice) and retrieves matching recipes from the TheMealDB API.  
The results are displayed as visual cards that include the meal name and image.
===================================================================================================================
This lab shows:
- A custom Node.js backend with an API endpoint (`/api/recipes`)
- A frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Fetching and rendering live data from an external REST API, where it's fine to use it in the assignment
- Separation of frontend and backend logic
- Client–server communication using HTTP requests
===================================================================================================================================================
The project fully satisfies the Lab 4 requirements by showing a working Node.js server, dynamic API integration, and a responsive user interface.
==============================------------------------------------==============================================================
## Built With
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Backend server and API routing  
[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) - Web page structure  
[CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Styling and layout  
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Frontend scripting and fetch requests  
[TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) - Public API used to get real meal data and images

How to Run, as IT WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU DO THAT, I TRIED AND IT WORKS THIS WAY
1. Open Git Bash or your terminal CMD.  
2. Go to the project directory:
cd lab4

3. Install dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the server:
node server.js IT WILL LOAD AND WILL SAY CONNECTED

5. Open a web browser and go to:
http://localhost:3000

API Details
TheMealDB is a free, public recipe API that provides meal data, images, and ingredient information.  
It is used here to dynamically populate recipes based on the user’s input.

Example endpoint:
https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=chicken

and for whoever is marking this, :https://reqbin.com/ 
this website if you pasted the api link on it, it will give you json format of how the api is from inside

================================================================================================================
Returns a JSON object containing meals that use the specified ingredient.  
Each meal includes:
- `strMeal`: Name of the meal  
- `strMealThumb`: Image URL  
==============================
## Debugging Tools Used
**Tool Used:** ChatGPT (OpenAI)  
**Purpose:** Used only for debugging and asking general questions, such as getting recommendations or verifying logic.    
**Why Used:** To confirm that the final project meets the Lab 4 requirements well.  
**Modifications:** All final code, structure, and logic were written manually by me. ChatGPT was not used to generate or write any line of code.
